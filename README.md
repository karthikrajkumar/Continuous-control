# Continuous-control

![Reacher Environment](https://github.com/karthikrajkumar/Continuous-control/blob/master/reacher.gif)

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

# Real world example
Watch this [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVIxt2rt1_4) video to see how some researchers were able to train a similar task on a real robot! The accompanying research paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07067.pdf).

# Environment Details
For this use case, we dont have to install Unity environment as it has already been built. please find the details specific to operating systems.
